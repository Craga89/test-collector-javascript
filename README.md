# Buildkite Test Analytics Collector for JavaScript


This package collects data about your test suite's performance and reliability, and allows you to see trends and insights about your test suite over time âœ¨

So far, it supports **Jest**. We hope to add more JavaScript test frameworks soon.

## Usage - Jest

1) Setup a project on [Buildkite Test Analytics](https://buildkite.com/test-analytics) and note the key
2) Add 'buildkite-analytics' to your npm packages
3) Configure Jest to use the reporter and enable `testLocationInResults`

```js
  // jest.config.js
  reporters: [
    'default',
    'buildkite-analytics/jest-reporter'
  ],
  testLocationInResults: true
```

4) set the environment variable for your test analytics
```sh
  export BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_API_TOKEN=xyz
```

5) Run your tests

To enable debugging, set `BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_DEBUG_ENABLED=true`
